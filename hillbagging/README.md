This is data from www.hill-bagging.co.uk - the Database of British and Irish Hills (DoBIH)

Most of the files were the database as of September 2018, except hillbagging_GB_wales+cornwall.csv which was downloaded in 2015, and names in Cornish (completely unofficial and some my own tentative translations) have been added to some in Cornwall. The file also includes hills in Devon within the SS and SX grid squares.

Where the 'source_kw' is listed as W, the translation is from "A concise Dictionary of Cornish Place Names" by Craig Weatherhill https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6217181-a-concise-dictionary-of-cornish-place-names
