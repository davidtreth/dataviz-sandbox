This is a module to write captions on the images from the Landsat365 images. This was a project in 2017 sharing a Landsat 8 image every day.

The website www.landsat365.org is no longer online as of Jan 2019, however see the archived page at http://web.archive.org/web/20180103153618/http://landsat365.org/ , the Twitter account www.twitter.com/landsat365 and Instagram: www.instagram.com/landsat365

I take the 'data-description' field within the link to the image from the index page as a caption text. Unfortunately although I downloaded the images during 2017 I don't have the rest of the metadata including the band combinations and precise location coordinates.
