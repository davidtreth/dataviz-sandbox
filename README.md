This repository will contain various data visualization experiments that don't fit neatly into my other projects.

### Data Visualization sandbox ###

* election2017/ - UK General Election June 2017 - some work using matplotlib pie charts and matplotlib_venn

* hillbagging/ - Data from www.hill-bagging.co.uk - at the moment it's mainly just an example for me to get some experience with Jupyter notebooks for Python.

* inkscape_extract_svg/ - a script to extract the icons from the Inkscape Open Symbols library to individual SVG files

* Jan2019_NLP_Talk/ - some experimentation based on the 31st January 2019 talk by Peter Conway to the Data Science Cornwall group https://www.meetup.com/datasciencecornwall/events/254352933/ on Natural Language Processing for sentiment analysis.

* landsat365/ - a script to overprint the titles on the images from the Landsat365 project (www.landsat365.org - no longer online but see @landsat365 on Twitter and Instagram)
