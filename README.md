This repository will contain various data visualization experiments that don't fit neatly into my other projects.

### Data Visualization sandbox ###

* election2017/ - UK General Election June 2017 - some work using matplotlib pie charts and matplotlib_venn

* hillbagging - Data from www.hill-bagging.co.uk - at the moment it's mainly just an example for me to get some experience with Jupyter notebooks for Python.
